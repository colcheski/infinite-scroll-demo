# infinite-scroll-demo
A small application to create an infinite scroll using unsplash api

***If we can find a more forgiving image api than unsplash to update this in the future that would be great, unsplash only allows 50 calls per hour which is fine for a demo, but while developing this I made a mistake that called it a few too many times and was forced to wait***
